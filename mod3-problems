# 1. Prompt the user for a word. Then, prompt the user for how many times they'd like that word repeated. Use the skills you learned in this module to print the word the correct number of times.
Word = input("What word do you want to use?")
Number_of_Times = int(input("How many times do you want this word to appear?"))
String = Word * Number_of_Times
print(String)
#2. Prompt the user for their name and their age. Calculate their age next year. Use string concatenation to print "Hello, <name>! You are <age1> years old. Next year, you will be <age2> years old."
name = input("What is your name?")
age1 = int(input("What is your age?"))
age2 = age1 + 1
print("Hello, " + name + "!" + " You are " + str(age1) + " years old. Next year, you will be " + str(age2) + " years old.")
#3. Prompt the user for a sentence and a word to try to find in that sentence. Have the program print out whether the word was found in the sentence. (i.e. True or False)
sentence = input("Write a sentence of any length.")
word = input("What word in that sentence do you want me to find?")
print(word in sentence)
#4. Prompt the user for: a word, a first index, and a last index. Slice the word at the indexes provided by the user and print to the screen.
WORD = input("What word do you want me to use?")
index1 = int(input("What is the first index?"))
index2 = int(input("What is the last index?"))
print(WORD[index1:index2])
#5. Print 3 words with a | character (called a pipe) in between them. Use the appropriate keyword argument in print() to do so.
phrase = "How are you?"
new_phrase = phrase.split(" ")
print(new_phrase)
new_phrase = "|".join(new_phrase)
print(new_phrase)
